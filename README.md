## How It Works
The test will be of 60 seconds. In the 60 seconds you have to type as fast and as accurate as you can. A paragraph with random words will be generated from a dictionary-common.txt file.

As the test starts (just type in the input box to start the test) a word will be highlighted and as you type, a script will check if the current letter is correct or not. if it is incorrect the word will turn to red. Green word indicates that the word is typed correctly.

After 60 seconds the test will automatically end and the result will be shown in the result page. It will show your wpm and accuracy as well real accuracy and incorrect words that you can work upon. In the next test try to beat your own highscore.
